          Though recently, I have been spending most of my time coding, and learning web development, Rather than making music or writing. This is because I really want to be able to support my partner financially so that she doesn't have to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We really want to become parents, but we don't want to raise children at my grandparents house, or in an empty household with both parents working; so it's very important that we get our own space, and earn enough money for her to be a stay at home wife and mom.

          This is my dream as well as hers, and I will stop at nothing to make it a reality. The only thing I want in this world is to start a family. Maybe it's a bit selfish, but I never got to have a real family growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without going into much detail my parents split up before I was born, and werent a very big part of my life, so I spent most of my upbringing with my grandparents, both of which worked a lot, but did the best they could to attempt to give me a normal life, despite it not being their responsiblility and for that I am eternally grateful. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to become a great web developer, so I can earn enough money to not rely on my grandparents, and so I can give my soon-to-be-wife the life she deserves. And with that, I put my wish in the ground, and sewed the seeds for our future. May they grow into a large, prosporous tree, with strong branches full of leaves, bountiful in fruit, and deep in it's roots.
